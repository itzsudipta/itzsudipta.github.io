            <p class="mb-4">Are you planning to start contributing to open source? If yes, trust me — you're already ahead of where I was when I started! 😅</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-4 mt-8">How It All Began</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Back in <span class="font-semibold text-sky-500">2023</span>, when I applied to <strong>GSSoC</strong> for the first time, I had zero idea about issues, branches, or PRs. My GitHub knowledge was literally: <em class="text-slate-400">git add . and hope for the best.</em></p>

        <p class="mb-4">I had just completed my diploma and was about to join <strong>Narula Institute of Technology</strong> for B.Tech — and in excitement, I directly made changes and raised a PR without even creating an issue.</p>

        <p class="mb-4 font-semibold text-rose-500">And the funniest part? I did it all on the <strong>main branch</strong> of the project owner's repo. Yes… THE MAIN branch. 💀</p>

        <p class="mb-4">That legendary mistake forced me to actually learn Git and GitHub properly — branching, PRs, contribution guidelines, everything.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-4 mt-8">Learning Git & GitHub Properly</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">After that chaos, I spent time understanding how open-source really works. I started maintaining my projects with Git, explored new tech, and tried contributing again.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">A year later, I reapplied. My PR wasn’t accepted, but instead of giving up, I took it as a sign:</p>
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-sky-500 pl-4 italic text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
          “You're close. Just keep going.”
        </blockquote>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-4 mt-8">2025 — My First Merged PR 🚀</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">In <strong>APERTRE 2.0 (2025)</strong>, my first PR finally got merged! That green "Merged" badge was pure happiness ✨</p>

        <p class="mb-4">A huge thanks to my close friend and mentor <strong>Arpan Chowdhury</strong>, who guided me with a better approach and helped me understand deeper contribution workflows.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">After that, I contributed to <strong>GirlScript Summer of Code</strong>, <strong>Hacktoberfest</strong>, and many other open-source events.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-4 mt-8">What I Learned</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Open source becomes easy once you understand the workflow.</li>
            <li>Don’t contribute anything random — make meaningful improvements.</li>
            <li>Learn Git & GitHub properly before you jump in.</li>
            <li>Small, consistent efforts lead to big confidence.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-4">So don’t worry if you’re starting fresh. Explore technology, practice GitHub basics, and slowly begin contributing. That's all you need.</p>

        <p class="p-4 rounded-xl bg-emerald-500/10 border border-emerald-500/40 text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-200 mt-6">
            <strong class="text-emerald-500">TL;DR:</strong> Open source looks scary at first, but once you understand the system, it becomes one of the most fun ways to learn, grow, and build confidence as a developer 💚.
