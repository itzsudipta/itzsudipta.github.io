## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the source code for my **Personal Portfolio Website**. 

It is engineered to serve as a digital identity, showcasing my **academic journey**, **technical proficiency**, and the **Scalable Web & ML Solutions** I have built. Beyond a showcase, this platform is designed to evolve into a central hub for my future experiments, research, and technical writing.

**Key Objectives:**
*   Showcase specialized skills in Python, Machine Learning, and Web Development.
*   Provide a centralized access point for my projects and résumé.
*   Demonstrate responsive, modern frontend design capabilities.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Workflow

The portfolio focuses on **performance** and **maintainability**. Instead of using heavy frameworks or CDNs, this project utilizes a local build process to generate optimized assets.

### Core Technologies

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)
![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)

### Build & Performance
*   **Local Tailwind Build:** I utilize the **Tailwind CLI** locally to scan HTML files and generate a highly optimized, minified CSS output file. This ensures zero unused CSS in production, significantly improving load times compared to CDN usage.
*   **AOS (Animate On Scroll):** Lightweight library for smooth, scroll-triggered animations without heavy overhead.
*   **Asset Optimization:** All images and scripts are optimized for mobile-first performance.
